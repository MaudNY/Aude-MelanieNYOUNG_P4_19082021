<h1>Getting started</h1>

*If you want to check the initial version of the website first, you can download its zip folder by clicking [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/GEN_integrateur_web_P4/Starting+website.zip)*

*If you only want to visit the optimized version of this website, click [here](https://maudny.github.io/P4_19082021_La-Chouette-Agence/)*

1. Create both local dedicated folders in your computer (1 for initial version / 1 for optimized one) and open your code editor
2. Open the optimized version folder and open a new terminal
3. Run ` git clone https://github.com/MaudNY/P4_19082021_La-Chouette-Agence.git ` to clone the code
4. Right click on ` index.html `, then click on ` Open with Live Server `
5. Do the same for initial version folder (without the repository cloning - just copy / paste the zip folder in your created folder)
6. Make sure to open another terminal before either staging, commiting or pushing your potential updates ;)
